  <title>Binance & Bybit P2P Auto Bidding Bot</title>

  <h1>Binance & Bybit P2P Auto Bidding Bot</h1>
  <p>
    In the P2P trading sections of Binance and Bybit, price competition is always one of the biggest headaches for merchants. In daily P2P bidding, if your competitor sets a price of 90,000, in theory, you only need to bid 90,001 to rank ahead of them. However, in practice, manual price adjustments are neither precise nor sustainable. Often, to secure a top ranking, you have to raise your price all the way to 90,050, and the extra 49 is simply lost profit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The P2P Auto Bidding Bot was created to solve this problem. You can pre-set your target competitors and the minimum increment, and the system will automatically scan market ads, bidding at a price that is “just slightly higher” to ensure your ad consistently stays at the top of search results.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, the bot can dynamically adjust prices according to market fluctuations, avoiding mistakes and delays caused by manual operations. This allows you to maintain your ranking while maximizing your profit, achieving truly efficient P2P trading.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, this software supports Binance and Bybit, and custom development is available for other exchanges such as OKX, HTX, Bitget, MEXC, Gate, KuCoin, Bitpapa, HodlHodl, and more.
